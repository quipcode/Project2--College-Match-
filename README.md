Plan

I wish to have the user create a profile on my site/app and on that site/app the user will be given a form to fill. This form will ask for where the user attended high school, SAT scores, GPA, what their major/interests, and most importantly what type of learning enviornment they wish to be in. With this information I will compare user's input to a database comprising of colleges and universities across the US. Utulizing a best match algorithim I will generate a list of campus that are most promising for the student.




Users will be asked household income, how they feel about student loans, whether they want to transfer in as a 2-year student or as a freshmen...
